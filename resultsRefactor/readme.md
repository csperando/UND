# Results Controller Refactor

There are two main files `original.cfc` and `new.cfc`. Both are components used as a controller for our results pages on our websites. The later is a much cleaner version that accomplishes the exact same thing, but with much better performance and takes advantage of the model-view-controller design pattern and basic OOP best practices. Rather than handeling all data access and business logic, these tasks have been moved to their own components serving as the models. The controller now simply determines what data to serve to the view based on the users' requests as desired.
